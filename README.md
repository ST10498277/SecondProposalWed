SECOND PROPOSAL 

 

To: LEGENDS BARBER SHOP 
From: RCC WEB DESIGNERS 
Date: August 24 2025  
Subject: Proposal for a Simple, Effective Website to attract new clients and modernize your online presence. 

 

The Opportunity 
Your barbershop has a great reputation and loyal clients. However, many potential new clients are searching online right now for a "barber near me." Without a website, you're missing these customers. A simple, professional website acts as your 24/7 digital storefront, working to attract new clients even while you're closed. 

 

 What I Propose 
I will create a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly website that does three key things: 

Showcases Your Work: A gallery of your best cuts and styles. 

Makes Booking Easy: Clear prices, services, and a prominent link to your existing booking system (if you have one) or your phone number. 

Builds Trust: Features your barbers' experience, customer testimonials, and easy-to-find contact information and hours. 

 

What's Included & The Investment 
This is a simple, one-time project designed for small businesses like yours. 

The "Essential Barber" Website Package: $899 

  Key Pages: Home, Services, Appointment page, About, Contact. 

 Mobile-Friendly Design: Looks perfect on any phone or computer. 

 Service & Price Menu: A clear list of your offerings (Haircut, Beard Trim, etc.). 

 

Why Now? 
Your competition is already online. A website is no longer a luxury; it's a essential tool for business growth. Itâ€™s the first-place people look to check your credibility, see your work, and decide where to book their next appointment. 

 

Next Steps 

Quick Chat: I'd love to buy you a coffee for 15 minutes to discuss your shop and answer any questions. 

Provide Content: You provide some photos and your service info. 

Go Live: I will handle everything else and launch your new website. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am confident that a professional website will be an asset for Legends Barber Shop and help you connect with your next loyal customers. 

 

Yours Sincerely
